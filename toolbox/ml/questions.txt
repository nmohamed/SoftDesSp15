What is the general trend in the curve?
	The accuracy goes up overall

Are there parts of the curve that appear to be noisier than others?  Why?
	Yes, towards the beginning. Probably because its using such a small amount of the data set that accuracy varies a lot.

How many trials do you need to get a smooth curve?
	A really large number. I tried doing 100 trials, and the overall increase was much more obvious. I think I'd have to do even more trials than that, and also have a smaller
	percent increment.
	
Try different values for C (by changing LogisticRegression(C=10**-10)).  What happens?  If you want to know why this happens, see this Wikipedia page as well as the documentation for LogisticRegression in scikit-learn
	The bigger it is (10**-1) to more of a curve that then plateus there is. If its larger, the opposite happens.
